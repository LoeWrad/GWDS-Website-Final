            <p>Hi, I'm Leo and I have been forced to create a website for this course,
                which is fine, I don't really mind too much. All you really need to know about me is that I do Digital
                Media and the musical
                faction for which I swear allegiance to is the Brian Jonestown Massacre. ⁽ˡᶦˢᵗᵉⁿ ᵗᵒ ᵗʰᵉᵐ⁾
                <br>
                <br>
                On this website you should expect to see the marvellous creations I have made from my time on
                this module. This is the home page, and below you will see my planning for this website and my
                reflection which I have written after completing the project. Enjoy!

            <p> As you might be able to tell from the navigation bar at the top, this website has multiple pages.
                This image right here is the sketch which I used to plan the layout of this website, It's simple and effective.
                Yeah I know my handwriting isnt that good but this page was A5 and it's hard to make small handwriting look nice.
                Looking back now it would have been better to use a ruler or something but this got the job done.

                The best part of any project is watching it all come together after working with it being ugly for so
                long,
                this was very much the case for this project. I started off with a number of ideas, only to start
                working on them,
                then realise that whatever I was working on looked kind of terrible, only to keep working on them and
                gradually see that they were
                actually becoming decent.
                This has been a pleasant project to undertake in a couple of ways. But has also had some downsides.
                <br>
                <br>
                Learning the basics relatively quickly in these past months has given me confidence going forward into
                future projects. Previously I knew some HTML from GCSE and A-Level computer science, but not a great
                amount of CSS. Now that I know how to make a basic website layout, I feel like most web development
                can be straight forward. At the start of the assignment I had never been familiar
                with using github, VS code, inDesign or Illustrator. After this Assignment I am now more proficient at
                creative software and I have developed the habit of saving, commiting and pushing to repositories every
                so often thanks to the worksheets.
                I am somewhat happy at the visual direction I took, From early on I wanted to make this website have a
                more personal touch, and wanted to make use of my drawing tablet. So I hand-drew each of the titles on
                this page through photoshop and added them as images.
                To keep the look simple and effective, I decided upon a dark slate grey, light grey and yellow (for some images) colour scheme to be easy
                on the eyes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although, like with most projects, there have been a few shortcomings. If I were to improve this
                website, I would definitely try to add more animation or interactive elements. I have also had some
                problems in CSS for example the "box-shadow" property, which sometimes stretches to a different height
                and width to their respective images. This happened to the typography page
                the most, but more or less has been fixed by resizing the images. Using adobe inDesign can be
                frustrating, some key functions from illustrator and photoshop aren't consistent (e.g moving anchor
                points). Also the poster templates we were given were in A4 instead of A3 by default,
                causing me some hassle having to re-adjust all my elements to A3 after my posters had already been
                finished.
                I'm not the most organised person, I usually have about fifty tabs open on firefox, and it can be hard
                to reopen a helpful website / blackboard once I find one. I will definitely try to improve my workspace
                and also get rid of distractions. Next semester I will remember to bring my desktop monitor down to
                Bristol because working on a 15.6 inch laptop screen is not very fun.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, I'm happy with the result, but I think I can do better, after all this is my first assignment
                and I guess I can only improve from here.

    <!--The process of learning about many things in HTML and CSS has been slightly tedious. Sometimes it can be annoying and exhaustive to research things by googling them or opening blackboard and navigating
                all the way to the right blackboard directory, only to realise it's actually the wrong module; or to find a helpful website, only to lose it among the hundreds of firefox tabs I have open.  -->
