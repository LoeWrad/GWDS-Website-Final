        <h1>What's this about?</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Leo and I have been forced to create a website for this course,
            which is fine, I don't really mind too much. All you really need to know about me is that the musical
            faction for which I swear allegiance to is the Brian Jonestown Massacre. ⁽ˡᶦˢᵗᵉⁿ ᵗᵒ ᵗʰᵉᵐ⁾
            <br>
            <br>
            On this website you should expect to see the marvellous creations I have made from my time on
            this module. This is the home page, and below you will see my planning for this website and my 
            reflection which I have written after completing the project. Enjoy!

                The best part of any project is watching it all come together after working with it being ugly for so long, 
                this was very much the case for this project. I started off with a number of ideas, only to start working on them, 
                then realise that whatever I was working on looked kind of terrible, only to keep working on them and gradually see that they were 
                actually becoming decent.
                This has been a pleasant project to undertake in a couple of ways. But has also had some downsides.
                <br>
                <br>
                Learning the basics relatively quickly in these past months has given me confidence going forward into future projects. Previously I knew some HTML from GCSE and A-Level computer science, but not a great amount of CSS. Now that I know how to make a basic website layout, I feel like most web development 
                can be straight forward. At the start of the assignment I had never been familiar 
                with using github, VS code, inDesign or Illustrator. After this Assignment I am now more proficient at creative software and I have developed the habit of saving, commiting and pushing to repositories every so often thanks to the worksheets.
                I am somewhat happy at the visual direction I took, From early on I wanted to make this website have a more personal touch, and wanted to make use of my drawing tablet. So I hand-drew each of the titles on this page through photoshop and added them as images. 
                I also decided upon a dark slate grey, light grey and yellow (for some images) colour scheme to be easy on the eyes.                
                <br>
                <br>
                Although, like with most projects, there have been a few shortcomings. If I were to improve this website, I would definitely try to add more animation or interactive elements. I have also had some problems in CSS for example the "box-shadow" property, which sometimes stretches to a different height and width to their respective images. This happened to the typography page 
                the most, but more or less has been fixed by resizing the images. Using adobe inDesign can be frustrating, some key functions from illustrator and photoshop aren't consistent (e.g moving anchor points). Also the poster templates we were given were in A4 instead of A3 by default, 
                causing me some hassle having to re-adjust all my elements to A3 after my posters had already been finished.
                I'm not the most organised person, I usually have about fifty tabs open on firefox, and it can be hard to reopen a helpful website / blackboard once I find one. I will definitely try to improve my workspace and also get rid of distractions. Next semester I will remember to bring my desktop monitor down to Bristol because working on a 15.6 inch laptop screen is not very fun.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, I'm happy with the result, but I think I can do better, after all this is my first assignment and I guess I can only improve from here.

 <!--The process of learning about many things in HTML and CSS has been slightly tedious. Sometimes it can be annoying and exhaustive to research things by googling them or opening blackboard and navigating
                all the way to the right blackboard directory, only to realise it's actually the wrong module; or to find a helpful website, only to lose it among the hundreds of firefox tabs I have open.  -->
