        <p>Hi, I'm Leo and I have been forced to create a website for this course,
            which is fine, I don't really mind too much. All you really need to know about me is that the musical
            faction for which I swear allegiance to is the Brian Jonestown Massacre. ⁽ˡᶦˢᵗᵉⁿ ᵗᵒ ᵗʰᵉᵐ⁾
            <br>
            <br>
            On this website you should expect to see the marvellous creations I have made from my time on
            this module. This is the home page, and below you will see my planning for this website and my 
            reflection which I have written after completing the project. Enjoy!

                The best part of any project is watching it all come together after working with it being ugly for so long, 
                this was very much the case for this project. I started off with a number of ideas, only to start working on them, 
                then realise that whatever I was working on looked kind of terrible, only to keep working on them and gradually see that they were 
                actually becoming decent (at least in my opinion).
                This has been a pleasant project to undertake in a couple of ways. Up until now, I have never taken such a coursework-centric course.
                Along with all my other projects in digital media, this has changed my time management from spending alot of time memorizing stuff to spending
                even more time in my £170 per week bedroom.
                <br>
                HTML and CSS seem to be very powerful tools, and learning the basics relatively quickly in these past months has given me a decent amount of
                confidence going forward.

                From early on I knew I wanted to make this website have a more personal touch, I also wanted to make use of my drawing tablet which I had already spent my
                hard earned cash on. So naturally I decided to hand-draw each of the titles on this page through photoshop and add them as images. I am probably not the only person 
                who has done this, but if I am the only one that would be pretty epic. I also started this project knowing that I didn't want to use the conventional dark-grey and white 
                colour scheme for my site
