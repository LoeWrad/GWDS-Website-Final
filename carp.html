            <p> This poster has heavy contrast between the colour scheme of black, light red and white.
                The typography in this poster is mostly dilatational, extending from a point of focus from the logo
                at the centre of the page.

            This is my first poster, which features pobably the most common idea
            being where the page is divided in two at an angle by the True/False logo.
            This design went through a few iterations because my first few attempts seemed to me a bit bland.
            Most of the text is aligned to the right side in the red area.

        </div>
        <div class="container-text">
            <p> For this poster I have a different colour scheme because the red/white/black scheme for the rest of the posters
                was getting boring, and I wanted to use a colour scheme which would conform with the rest of my website.
                This builds on the theme of repetition as the grey background contains repeated use of check marks, crosses and
                "TRUEFALSE" text, each in different segments. I decided to use a more Dilatational approach to the typography in this poster.

            <p> This was my last poster where I decided to place the majority of the text in close proximity in the

            <p> These are my iterations...
                The poster with the most iterations was alignment...
                All posters had an original version without borders- it shouldn't be too hard to imagine. I added them
                because it helped make each poster look more "full" to me.
