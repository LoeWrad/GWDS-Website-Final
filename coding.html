                While already knowing some HTML from GCSE and A-Level computer science, I wasn't very familiar with
                CSS. It was interesting finding out what CSS was all about. Other than that it was quite straightforward
                to learn,
                the worksheets were put together pretty well and had a smooth gradual increase in difficulty.
                Most of all this helped me get familiar with github desktop, as before that I never really understood
                how repositories worked
                or what "push" "commit" and "get" meant despite hearing those terms by pretty much every developer.
                Below is an embed for the result of my worksheets.

                Week 4 and 5 taught me about the uses of flexbox, and to be honest I don't like it that much at the moment. I found it annoying to use but i'm sure my skills will develop with it eventually.
                Embedding videos, images and adding fonts was generally easy to do, and I feel like I won't have many problems with them going forward.

                Note: At the time I am working on this, the placeholder image isn't working because I think placekitten.net is currently down (sad).
